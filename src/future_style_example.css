/**
A stand-alone style sheet that will contain the styling data
for the Declaration of Independence content. This will make it
more organized and more separated. Although the original
intention WAS to make the embedded content blend in seamlessly
with the main site page, which it did fine with, segregating
them will make it better-organized.
