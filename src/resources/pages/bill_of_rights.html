<h2>About</h2>
<p>The <b>United States Bill of Rights</b> comprises the first ten <a href="/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution" class="mw-redirect" title="List of amendments to the United States Constitution">amendments</a> to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Constitution" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. Proposed following the often bitter 1787â€“88 debate over the <a href="/wiki/Timeline_of_drafting_and_ratification_of_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Timeline of drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution">ratification of the Constitution</a> and written to address the objections raised by <a href="/wiki/Anti-Federalism" title="Anti-Federalism">Anti-Federalists</a>, the Bill of Rights amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and <a href="/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights" class="mw-redirect" title="Natural and legal rights">rights</a>, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically granted to the <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">federal government</a> by the Constitution are reserved to the <a href="/wiki/U.S._state" title="U.S. state">states</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Popular_sovereignty" title="Popular sovereignty">people</a>. The concepts <a href="/wiki/Codification_(law)" title="Codification (law)">codified</a> in these amendments are built upon those in earlier documents, especially the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights" title="Virginia Declaration of Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> (1776), as well as the <a href="/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance" title="Northwest Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a> (1787),<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> the <a href="/wiki/Bill_of_Rights_1689" title="Bill of Rights 1689">English Bill of Rights</a> (1689), and <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> (1215).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Largely because of the efforts of Representative <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a>, who studied the deficiencies of the Constitution pointed out by Anti-Federalists and then crafted a series of corrective proposals, Congress approved twelve articles of amendment on September 25, 1789, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's proposal that the proposed amendments be incorporated into the main body of the Constitution (at the relevant articles and sections of the document), they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the <a href="/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-seventh Amendment</a>. <a href="/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment" title="Congressional Apportionment Amendment">Article One</a> is still pending before the states.</p>
<p>Although Madison's proposed amendments included a provision to extend the protection of some of the Bill of Rights to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>. Since the early 20th century both <a href="/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States" title="Federal judiciary of the United States">federal</a> and <a href="/wiki/State_court_(United_States)" title="State court (United States)">state courts</a> have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill of Rights to state and local governments. The process is known as <a href="/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights" title="Incorporation of the Bill of Rights">incorporation</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup></p>
