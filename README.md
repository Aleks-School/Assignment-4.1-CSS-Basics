**# Assignment-4.1-CSS-Basics**

A basic practice website with all the pages of the United States Declaration of Independence, as well as some
additional information. Plans are made to improve the practice website, and in doing so, learn new skills
and/or become more accustomed the elements of website design.

**Future Improvements:**  
Replace current HTML file content data to XML files for use with the site, give content a separate
CSS file and dress it up with better embedding, re-work the page index with more options and better grouping,
add in-site links and custom id's for improved site navigation, improve the site UI, re-do the code to reflect
the other improvements, as well as undo some existing functionality, and finally add more information about the
Constitution and its' history. Will also organize the resource system into a few additional subcategories.

**Considering:**
Wikipedia API Usage: I already made a Wikipedia search-engine a few years ago, so I might not have as much to learn.
CSS Variables: Add custom themes to the website. Unneccessary but potentially interesting.
